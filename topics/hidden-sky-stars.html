  <h1>Why Don’t We See Stars Anymore?</h1>
  <p>
    A research-based examination of changes in night sky visibility.
  </p>
</header>

<h2>1. Documented Explanations</h2>
<p>
Light pollution, skyglow, LED lighting, and atmospheric scattering are the
primary documented causes of reduced star visibility in urban environments.
</p>

<h2>2. Historical Observation Gaps</h2>
<p>
Historical astronomy records and cultural descriptions suggest significantly
greater night sky visibility prior to widespread artificial lighting.
</p>

<div class="section-note">
This section highlights gaps and discrepancies in historical observation, not evidence of intent.

<h2>3. Speculative Interpretations</h2>
<p>
The following ideas are speculative and are presented without assertion.
They attempt to interpret unresolved questions rather than provide conclusions.
